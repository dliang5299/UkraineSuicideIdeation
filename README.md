# UkraineSuicideIdeation

In this project, we are exploring risk factors for suicide ideation between two groups of age cohorts, as defined by Bromet et. al 2005 and by previous researchers in this topic.

### Variables

(8, 9 -> NA) and (5 -> 0) unless otherwise noted

1) Religiosity

- DE32:  Separate variables for each religion. Categorized into Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Other
- DE34: “How important is religion to you?”

2) Chronic Condition - Cancer (Y/N)

- CC1tz: do you have cancer?
- CC2: treatment for cancer? 

4) Marital status (SC3, MR16, MR18, MR22)  

- Single
- Divorced
- Married
- Seperated (not living with spouse)
- Widowed

- PT6a: Were you living in the contamination zone affected by the explosion of Chernobyl? 
- PT6b: Were you exposed to radiation in Chernobyl because you worked as a liquidator?
- DE40: Have you ever lived in the zone contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl accident?

- Ability to open up - SN7 (reverse scale, 8, 9 -> 2.5)
- Contact with family not living with them - SN1 
- Contact with friends - SN2
- Frequency of Affiliative Interaction Scale: reverse coding of SN1 and SN2 so that Never = 0, Nearly Every Day = 5. SCORE = (sum(SN1, SN2) - 2)/8

13) Mental disorder (Y/N) 

- Mood Disorders
